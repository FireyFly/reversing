 Reverse-engineering projects
==============================

  This repository contains my own personal notes and code from assorted
  personal reverse-engineering projects.  This isn't (generally) proper
  documentation, but more my work-in-progress notes and hacky programs/scripts
  for reading/working with the format.

  The idea is that *something* is better than nothing at all, when it comes to
  reversing, so in the absence of proper documentation (which often seems to
  succumb to the same "it's not quite ready for public consumption just yet"
  just as much as code does) at least there might be something here to look
  at.  There's no guarantee of correctness, completeness, or quality of any
  kind (of either documentation or code).

  In fact, the source code in this repository is almost "intentionally bad",
  in the sense that it's written with the express goal of furthering my
  understanding of a format, and thus prioritising implementation pace over
  maintainable and portable code.
